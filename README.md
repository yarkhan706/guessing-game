# Random Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Random Number Guessing Game! This simple web app allows you to guess a random number between 1 and 10. You have three chances to guess the correct number.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. You will see a header with the game title and a total guess counter, initially set to `3`.
3. Enter a number between 1 and 10 in the input field and click the "SUBMIT" button to make a guess.
4. You will receive feedback on whether your guess is correct or not.
5. If your guess is incorrect, the game will provide hints to help you find the correct number.
6. You have a total of three chances to guess the correct number. The "TOTAL GUESS LEFT" counter will decrease with each incorrect guess.
7. If you guess the correct number, the game will display a success message and generate a new random number for the next round.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the game layout and elements.
- `style.css`: The CSS file with styles for the header, main div, and input elements.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file with the logic for the game.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the game elements by modifying the CSS styles in the `style.css` file. Additionally, you can modify the game logic in the `index.js` file to adjust the behavior of the game.
